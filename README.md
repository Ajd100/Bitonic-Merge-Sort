# Bitonic-Merge-Sort
Java Implementation of Bitonic-Merge-Sort

bitonicSort.java is basic, uses arrays to sort any array given. - Doesn't work unless it's a power of two and can't pad because it's an array <br><br>
bitonicSort2.java is identical to bitonicSort.java but showcases what happens when you try to sort an array that isn't a power of 2 <br><br>
finalBitonicSort.java uses an ArrayList<Integer> to sort - Allows padding to power of 2 to sort successfully. Then cleans up output and deletes all 0's <br><br>
bitonicSortFiles.java is just like finalBitonicSort.java but is adapted to accept a file full of numbers. Should crash if there are characters found. Included is a textfile that has just integers which is converted to an integer array then an ArrayList<Integer"() Comments explain what the methods do <br><br>
